Ports are locations scattered across the world that let you <color=orange>ship items</color> and <color=orange>teleport</color> between them. If this is the first port you've found, congratulations — you've begun your shipping journey! Ports become much more useful as you discover more of them in the world.

<color=orange><b>How it works</b></color>
<size=5>●</size> Find a port and talk to its <color=orange>Port Manager</color> to discover it — it will then appear as a destination at all other ports
<size=5>●</size> Buy a <color=orange>manifest</color> from the Port Manager. Manifests are the shipping chests you use to transport items between ports. You can purchase up to three manifests per shipment, and higher tiers unlock as you discover more advanced materials. Fill your manifest chests with the items you want to ship
<size=5>●</size> Once the chests are loaded, talk to the Port Manager again and use the <color=yellow>Port</color> tab to select a destination. There will be a shipment fee that scales with distance — pay the fee by clicking <color=yellow>[Send Shipment]</color> and your shipment will be on its way
<size=5>●</size> You can see the status of all your active shipments in the <color=yellow>Shipment</color> tab
<size=5>●</size> Travel to the destination port, open the <color=yellow>Delivery</color> tab, and once the shipment has arrived click collect — the chests will appear!

<color=yellow>Note:</color> Travel time is based on in-game time, not real-life time.
