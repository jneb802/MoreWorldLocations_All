Shipments are where players can see the status of their shipments

Once a player sends a shipment, their details will show up in two places:
1. Port tab, that has the information of the port along with all their deliveries and <color=orange>shipments</color>, but do not have the details of the contents of the shipment
2. Shipment tab will have a list of shipments from the <color=orange>current port</color> and will have the details of the contents of the shipment

Players can use the shipment tab to have a detailed report of the entire shipment, including the manifest, time to arrival and state
