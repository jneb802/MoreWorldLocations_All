The delivery tab will keep track of the incoming shipments

Players will be able to see the details of the specific shipments that are incoming, and open the delivery shipment when it is marked as delivered

When the player opens a delivery, the manifests will load the containers and all the items into their respective chests

As soon as the player takes all the items out the delivery shipment, the containers will disappear and the shipment will be marked as complete,
which will be sent to server to synchronize the entire list of shipments
